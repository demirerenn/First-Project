This study was done to understand machine learning. The codes are written in the python programming language.The data belong to the students of a high school. Based on 10 observations such as gender, age, height and weight, it was aimed to estimate the 30-meter running time of students aged 15-17.   It is aimed to be predicted separately with 10 machine learning models(Linear Regression, KNN, SVR, MLP, CART, Random Forests, GBM, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost). Due to the insufficiency of computer hardware, a limited number of parameter values have been tried in machine learning models.
